UI Router Exercises

You can download UI Router from https://unpkg.com/angular-ui-router@0.3.2/release/angular-ui-router.js

Because template url only work when Ajax is working and Ajax does not work with local HTML files, to run your AngularJS application I recommend using the serve command line, which can be installed by

npm install -g serve
Once it is installed, go the the directory of your project and run:

serve
After this you can access the files from http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

You can use the examples in ui-router-examples.zip as reference. You will unzip them, cd into the directory and use serve to serve up the files.

Family members

Make a site about either your pets or your family, or both. You will make a separate page for each member and you will use UI Router routing to make a URL to each pseudo page within the SPA application.

Beginnings of a Wiki

You will make a Wiki application, except it will not persist to the database, but only store the pages in a JavaScript object. The object will use the page names of the pages as the keys.

function WikiPage(title, content) {
  this.title = title;
  this.content = content;
}

var pages = {
  Python: new WikiPage('Python', 'Python is a fun to use programming language. It is great for beginners.'),
  HTML: new WikiPage('HTML', 'HTML is the markup language used for making pages on the world wide web.')
};
Step 1

Set up the router such that going to the URL #/Python will display the title and the contents of the Python page, and same for other pages with their respective page name. It will make use of:

$stateProvider
$stateParams

create a page_view.html template HTML file

create a PageViewController. It will need to take in the $stateParams object in order to access the matched page name parameter from the URL.
create a state definition in the app.config section with the $stateProvider. The state definition will have a name, a URL. The URL will match the pattern /{page_name}, and associate the template URL to page_view.html and the controller to PageViewController.
In the PageViewController, get the page name parameter from the $stateParams object and attach it to the scope of the controller so that the template can render the page name.
Look up the WikiPage object keyed by the page name on the pages object. Save this object as a scope variable so that the template can render its content.
Render the title and the content of the page in the page_view.html template, if the page exists.
Step 2: Placeholder page

If the page does not exist, display the following message: "This page does not exist yet." and you will provide a "Create it" link to allow them to create the page. See next step.

Step 3: The edit page

Set up the router such that the route #/Python/edit will load the page editor (a form and a textarea within it) to edit the Python page. It will pre-populate the textarea with the content of the page in it.

create a 'page_edit.html' template file
create a PageEditController. It will also need the $stateParams object.
create a state definition for the page_edit state. Its URL will be /{page_name}/edit.
In the controller, use the $stateParams object to get the page name as with the PageViewController. Render a form with a textarea to edit the content of the wiki page object.
Create a done button which simply links to the page view for the same page.
Linkable Memory Game

Use UI Router to make your Memory game linkable. So that you can copy the link for a medium sized board, for example, send it to a friend and he will be able to see the medium sized board immediately. There should be 4 different linkable URLs:

front page with the menu
easy board
medium board
difficult board
